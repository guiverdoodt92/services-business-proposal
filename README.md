This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Summary

This project is a modern proposal editor built with Next.js, designed to streamline the creation and sharing of professional project proposals. Users can input company and client details, outline project items with pricing, and customize the document with branding elements such as logos and watermarks. The editor provides real-time calculation of totals, supports multiple currencies (USD, BRL), and ensures a responsive, user-friendly experience. Proposals can be easily shared or exported, making it an efficient tool for consultants, agencies, and businesses to communicate value to clients.
